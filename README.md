## About the Project

This project is a clone of a desktop-only Figma design. It was built using React and Tailwind, and serves as an exercise in front-end development. The design was originally intended for desktop use only, so I had to adapt it for a responsive web application. Through this project, I was able to gain experience in both React and Tailwind, and improve my skills in front-end development.
